Mobile Ravelry 

This project has begun as a _playground_ for a couple of geeks, living in a very rural area (Technology Starved), to share, learn, grow, play, explore and have some fun.

We try to meet regularly.  Since we always share a coffee, I like to call us the __L__ady __L__ake __C__ode & __C__offee __K__latsch.

As a regualr user on Ravelry, with a desire to learn-by-doing to construct a mobile app, it seems logical to explore the [Ravelry API](http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravelry-api/pages/API-Documentation) and build a mobile application provides all the features __we__ really want.


This is [currently] a small, close group.  But we do not intend to be exclusive.
Comments, Suggestions and Pull Requests are welcome.
